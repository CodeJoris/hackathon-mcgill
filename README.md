We coded an arcade-type game utilizing physical concepts such as Newton's 2nd Law and thrusters. The game was made entirely with Python, using the Pygame and Numpy libraries.

The objective of the game is to control the orbit of a satellite and increase it's velocity by applying boosts with thrusters and utilizing the gravitational attraction of the Sun. The player wins when the satellite has reached a high enough velocity for a long enough amount of time while still maintaining a stable orbit. Careful, though, as you cannot crash into the Sun or exit the playing screen!

The project aims to help people gain intuition with gravitational attraction between objects in space. While it is known that orbit equations can be derived from physical equations, this simulation also shows that these same orbits can be achieved by constantly re-evaluating the forces applied on an object and adding this acceleration to the velocity of the orbiting object.
